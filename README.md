## GOV.UK frontend

This gem uses [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend), part of the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

We use `npm` to download the govuk-frontend package. To update to a new version, change the version in the [package.json file](package.json) and run `npm update`.

## Issue with FFI on OSX Mojave

Users on OSX Mojave (10.14) may get this error when running `bundle exec middleman serve` on apps that use this gem.

There are 3 possible ways to solve this. From best to worst, you can:

* upgrade to macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or higher
* tell rubygems not to use the system ffi by running `gem install ffi -- --disable-system-libffi` in the command line when the error shows
* pin the ffi version back to 1.12.2 by editing the Gemfile of your app

## Releasing new versions

To release a new version, create a new pull request (PR) that updates [version.rb](lib/govuk_tech_docs/version.rb) and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

Do not include other changes in your pull request, as this makes it easier to find out what was released when. See an example of a [PR for releasing a new version](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/pull/15).

Travis will automatically release a [new version to Rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/govuk_tech_docs).
