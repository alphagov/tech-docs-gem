need to port your changes back in.

```sh
rm -rf lib source/images source/layouts source/favicon.ico source/javascripts/* source/stylesheets/*

echo "//= require govuk_tech_docs" > source/javascripts/application.js
echo "@import 'govuk_tech_docs';" > source/stylesheets/screen.css.scss

echo '$is-print: true;

@import "govuk_tech_docs";' > source/stylesheets/print.css.scss

echo '$is-ie: true;
$ie-version: 8;

@import "govuk_tech_docs";' > source/stylesheets/screen-old-ie.css.scss

echo "require 'govuk_tech_docs'

GovukTechDocs.configure(self)" > config.rb
