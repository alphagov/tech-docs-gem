You can look at the [2.0.6 milestone](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/milestone/2?closed=1) for the closed issues, and [pull request #129: Accessibility improvements](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/pull/129) for details on how these issues were fixed.

## 2.0.5


Adds [new global configuration option](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/pull/122) that controls whether review banners appear or not at the bottom of pages when expiry dates are set in the frontmatter.

[Fixes the hard-coded service link](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/pull/119) in the header.

Selectively include only the CSS for the GOV.UK Frontend components that we are using, to reduce the size of the CSS file served to the user ([#118](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/issues/118))

Fix service name to link to the configured `service_link`, rather than being hardcoded to `/` ([#119](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/issues/119))

Add the `show_review_banner` global configuration option allowing users to hide the page review banner.

## 2.0.4

Adds `footer_links` option for displaying links in the footer and ability to hide pages from left hand navigation.

## 2.0.3

Fixes a couple of styling issues: [#100](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/issues/100) and [#106](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/issues/106).

## 2.0.2

This fixes ensures all assets from govuk-frontend are bundled; we were missing some PNG, SVG and ICO files.

## 2.0.1

This fixes an issue where Travis CI wasn’t packaging up the gem with the govuk-frontend module.
Without this the tech-docs have no css styles.

## 2.0.0

This release adds [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) (part of the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk)) and remove the legacy framework [GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit). This required a lot of markup being ported over
to use the design system’s markup and all custom CSS to use new variables and mixins.

Custom components such as the table of contents (toc) were updated to use the WCAG 2.1 AA compliant focus states too.

It was also necessary to upgrade the Ruby version to `2.6.3` so that we could bump the gem versions of `govuk_lint`, `rubocop` and `sprockets`. The new version of sprockets allowed us to pull through assets from `node_modules/govuk-frontend` without having to manually include them as was the case before with govuk_frontend_toolkit.

## 1.8.3

Fixes bug where search results disappear when opening results in a new tab, making it difficult to open several results in a batch (PR #86).

## 1.8.2

Adds a `show_expiry` config option to allow you to choose whether to show the review due date and expired banner from your pages. Find out more about the [page expiry and review feature][expiry].

## 1.8.1

This release fixes a bug (#79 - reported in
[alphagov/tech-docs-template#183][tdt-183]) which prevented a multipage site
from being generated when a custom `http_prefix` was configured.

## 1.8.0

🎉 Our first contributor from outside of GDS. Thanks [@timja](https://github.com/timja) from [HMCTS](https://hmcts.github.io)! 🤝

New features: you can now configure a different GitHub branch for the repo to generate the "View source" link in the footer. Use `github_branch` in your config file (#71). You can also specify a `full_service_name` in the config, which is used in the browser title and meta tags (#72).

This version also fixes a bug with unclickable links (#74 - reported in [alphagov/tech-docs-template#123](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template/issues/123)).

## 1.7.0

New features: this release adds support for a full-width page (#63) and adding HTML to the `head` of the page (#64).

This release also makes sure that all pages are returned in the `/api/pages.json` endpoint (#66).

## 1.6.3

The gem now uses `middleman-search-gds` rather than `middleman-search`, which
removes the need for projects to point to the alphagov github repository in
their Gemfiles. We will continue to maintain our own fork until the changes
are merged into the upstream project.

## 1.6.2

This version fixes an issue with Middleman hanging (PR #54). It also allows the API reference page to include multiple servers and their descriptions (PR #53).

## 1.6.1

### Make `api_path` configuration optional

A bug in the previous release prevented the docs from being generated if
`api_path` was missing. This is now fixed.

## 1.6.0

Version 1.6.0 adds API reference generation, and improves the search function.

### New feature: API reference

Specify an OpenAPI spec file using `api_path`, for example: `api_path: source/pets.yml`.

To output the generated content in the page of your choice, write `api>` in any markdown parsed file (.md, .html.md, .html.md.erb). You can also specify to just print a specific path: `api> /pets`

This generates request and response schemas and examples for each API operation.

The following script upgrades your project. This will work if you've not made

need to port your changes back in.

```sh
rm -rf lib source/images source/layouts source/favicon.ico source/javascripts/* source/stylesheets/*

echo "//= require govuk_tech_docs" > source/javascripts/application.js
echo "@import 'govuk_tech_docs';" > source/stylesheets/screen.css.scss

echo '$is-print: true;

@import "govuk_tech_docs";' > source/stylesheets/print.css.scss

echo '$is-ie: true;
$ie-version: 8;

@import "govuk_tech_docs";' > source/stylesheets/screen-old-ie.css.scss

echo "require 'govuk_tech_docs'

GovukTechDocs.configure(self)" > config.rb
