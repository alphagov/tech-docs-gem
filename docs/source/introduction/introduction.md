# Tech Docs Template

## What you can use this tool for

This tool is a template for technical and developer documentation.

It uses the [Middleman static site generator](https://middlemanapp.com/) to convert markdown files into HTML-based documentation that looks consistent with the GOV.UK and GDS style and format.

It is suitable for multiple styles of documentation, including API documentation.

## Why you should use this tool

It promotes consistency on technical documentation which should reassure end users.

It helps technical writers manage their technical content using the [‘docs as code’](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2017/08/25/why-we-use-a-docs-as-code-approach-for-technical-documentation/) approach.

This documentation is currently under construction.

## Who should use this tool

The Tech Docs Template is intended for internal use by the GDS and government community.
